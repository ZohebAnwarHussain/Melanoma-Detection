## General Information
- To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
- The data set contains the following diseases:

	Actinic keratosis
	Basal cell carcinoma
	Dermatofibroma
	Melanoma
	Nevus
	Pigmented benign keratosis
	Seborrheic keratosis
	Squamous cell carcinoma
	Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
- As the accuracy of the model increases, the loss decreases. The final model has an accuracy of 89% and a loss of 0.31 on the Validation set. Augmenting the data and countering class imbalance helped in improving the accuracy of the model.
